### **What is Trackversal?**

Trackversal is an **all-in-one tracking device.** It combines the power efficiency and low overhead of a Bluetooth tracker \(such as Tile\) while retaining the long range and versatility of GPS trackers. 

When a Trackversal device is near your phone, it automatically switches to Bluetooth mode. When you walk away and get out of range, it automatically switches to GPS mode.
